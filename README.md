Overview**
The goal of this project is to predict customer churn, which refers to the situation when customers stop using a product or service. Churn modeling is an essential task for businesses to understand customer behavior and develop strategies to retain customers.

In this project, we utilize an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to create a predictive model. ANN is a machine learning algorithm inspired by the biological neural networks of the human brain. It consists of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers and can learn complex patterns from data.

**Dataset**
The dataset used for this churn modeling project can be found in the data directory. It contains information about customer attributes and churn status. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the model.

churn_dataset.csv: The main dataset file containing customer attributes and churn status.
Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

**git clone https://github.com/ganeshkadam07/churn-modeling-ann.git**
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd churn-modeling-ann
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To use the churn modeling project, follow these steps:

Ensure that you have installed all the dependencies mentioned in the requirements.txt file.

Run the churn_modeling_ann.py script:

bash
Copy code
python churn_modeling_ann.py
The script will train the ANN model on the dataset and provide evaluation metrics and predictions on the test set.

You can modify the model configuration and hyperparameters in the churn_modeling_ann.py script according to your needs.

Results
After running the churn_modeling_ann.py script, you will see the evaluation metrics of the model on the test set. The metrics may include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and others, depending on the problem and dataset.

Additionally, the script may generate visualizations such as confusion matrices, ROC curves, or learning curves, depending on the implementation.
